This is an experimental fork of the [Gwt project](gwtproject.org), hosted at [gwt.googlesource.com](https://gwt.googlesource.com/gwt/).

This fork currently has (very) basic support for java 8 language features, which was picked up from [Ray Cromwell](plus.google.com/+RayCromwell)'s [github fork](https://github.com/cromwellian/gwt-sandbox/tree/java8).  
There is a [precompiled zip](https://github.com/WeTheInternet/gwt-sandbox/releases/tag/java8) of the initial implementation, which is rebased directly on top of the Gwt 2.6 release.


This fork will be updated with hot new prerelease features as they become available (up next, [magic method injection](https://github.com/WeTheInternet/xapi/tree/master/gwt/gwt-method-inject) from [xapi](https://github.com/WeTheInternet/xapi))
