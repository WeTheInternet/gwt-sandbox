 * Emulated File class without any implementation whatsoever.
 *
 * This is to allow (unused) references to File in shared code;
 * web mode can't use anything other than the File.separator / pathSeparator,
 * at least until we come up with a good virtualization strategy,
 * perhaps using web mode blobs and asynchronous access to files,
 * since we really can't block on reads in web mode.
 *
 * A possibly better option would be to use the File object just to hold
 * metadata from a server-side "file", and require web mode use of the
 * Input/OutputStreams to use asynchronous methods,
 * so we can dispatch get/set through http, without blocking.
